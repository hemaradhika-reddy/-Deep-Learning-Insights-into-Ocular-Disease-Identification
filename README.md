# -Deep-Learning-Insights-into-Ocular-Disease-Identification
Ocular diseases like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and macular degeneration can cause blindness if undetected. This project applies deep learning for automated diagnosis using retinal images. We employ transfer learning with pretrained models (DenseNet, VGG19, Inception, ResNet50, MIRNet) to improve accuracy and efficiency in disease recognition.
